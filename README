NOTE: THIS IS PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT.  IT IS
NOT YET FUNCTIONAL!  IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE USED BY ANYONE BUT
DEVELOPERS IMPLEMENTING CORE FUNCTIONALITY.  When the software is
deemed ready for testing, it will be given a version number of "0.1".

1.0 About
---------

Symon is a general purpose simulator for systems based on the NMOS
Mostek 6502 microprocessor and compatibles.  Symon is implemented in
Java.  It's core goals are accuracy, ease of development, clear
documentation, and extensive test suites for validating correctness.

The initial goal is to simulate a system with an NMOS 6502 or CMOS
65C02 central processor; one or more 6522 VIAs; and one or more 6551
ACIAs.  More functionality may be considered as time goes on.

2.0 Usage
---------

  2.1 Requirements

  - Java 1.5 or higher
  - Maven 2.0.x or higher (for building from source)
  - JUnit 3.0 or higher (for testing)

  (More to come!)

3.0 To Do
---------

- Finish core functionality.
- Implement remaining addressing modes.

  COMPLETED ADDRESSING MODES:
    o Implied
    o Immediate
    o Zero Page
    o Accumulator
    o Absolute

  INCOMPLETE ADDRESSING MODES:
    o Zero Page, X-indexed
    o Zero Page, Y-indexed
    o Relative
    o Absolute, X-indexed
    o Absolute, Y-indexed
    o Indirect
    o Indexed Indirect [ (Indirect ,X) ]
    o Indirect Indexed [ (Indirect),Y ]

- Clean up JavaDoc.
- Implement CMOS 65C02 instructions and NMOS / CMOS mode flag.
